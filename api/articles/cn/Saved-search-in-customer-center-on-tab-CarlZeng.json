The “Use Permissions” checkbox must be checked<br>3. On the Permissions tab, select the Customer Center role(s) that you will assign to your Customer Center users, and give them at least “View” level access.<br>2. Create a saved search for your custom record type.

Navigate to Setup &gt; Customization &gt; Center Tabs &gt; New to setup a new Custom Center Tab.\"></a>1. Navigate to Setup &gt; Customization &gt; Center Tabs &gt; New to setup a new Custom Center Tab.</h3><p>1. You can enter any text you want for the Label (this is the label that will appear for the custom tab in Customer Center), but MUST select Center &#x3D; “Customer Center”.<br>2. Under Content &gt; Categories &gt; Label, you can enter any name you want (this is the label that will appear for the category in your custom tab).<br>3. Under Content &gt; Portlets &gt; Type, you MUST select Type &#x3D; “Links” and Show &#x3D; “Yes”.<br>4. Under Audience, make sure that the “Select All” checkbox is checked for the Roles list.<br>5. Save your new Custom Center tab.<br>2. Navigate to Setup &gt; Customization &gt; Center Tabs, and click on the NAME of the new Custom Center Tab that you just created (do NOT click on the “Edit” link; you want to view the Custom Center Tab that you just created).<br>1. Under Content &gt; Categories, click on the “Edit” link for the Category that you created.<br>2. On the Custom Center Category page, select the Link for the saved search that you created in the Common Steps section above (i.e., the saved search that you want to display on Customer Center).<br>1. IMPORTANT: When you look in the Link list for your saved search, you will find 2 entries for your saved search with similar names. One entry in the list will have “Results” in the name, the other will not have “Results” in the name. (For example, if your saved search is called “Subscription Data”, then you will see one entry in the Link list will be “Subscription Data”, and the second entry will be “Subscription Data Results”.) You MUST select the entry with “Results” in the name. The difference between these two entries is this: the link that does not have “Results” in the name (for example, “Subscription Data”) takes you to the page where you edit the search itself; the link with “Results” in the name (for example, “Subscription Data Results”) takes you to the page that shows the actual search results. Another way to look at this is like this: when you go to look at all of your Saved Searches in your normal NetSuite account, you always see two links next to each search. One link is called “Edit”, which takes you to the page where you define what the search is. The second link is called “Results”, which actually runs the search and takes you to a page that shows the results. The “Subscription Data” link is equivalent to the “Edit” link. The “Subscription Data Results” link is equivalent to the “Results” link.<br>3. Save your changes to the Custom Center Category.<br>3. Test this in Customer Center by logging in as one of your customers and verify the following:<br>1. You should see the new custom tab, category, and link you just created.<br>1. NOTE: If you don’t see the new tab, category, and&#x2F;or link, then you should hit CTRL-F5 to reload and re-cache each page in Customer Center so that you are sure that you are looking at the latest versions of the Customer Center pages.<br>2. When you click on the link, the search results should only display custom records associated with the customer that you are logged in as.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Method-2-Using-a-Published-Saved-Search\"><a href=\"#Method-2-Using-a-Published-Saved-Search\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method 2: Using a Published Saved Search\"></a>Method 2: Using a Published Saved Search</h3><h3 id=\"1-Navigate-to-Lists-Web-Site-Tab-New-New-Presentation-Tab-to-create-a-new-Web-Site-Tab-where-you-can-access-your-published-saved-search-You-could-use-an-existing-tab-but-for-instruction-purposes-we’ll-create-a-new-tab-The-new-Presentation-Tab-can-be-set-up-however-you-want-but-the-setup-MUST-include-the-following\"><a href=\"#1-Navigate-to-Lists-Web-Site-Tab-New-New-Presentation-Tab-to-create-a-new-Web-Site-Tab-where-you-can-access-your-published-saved-search-You-could-use-an-existing-tab-but-for-instruction-purposes-we’ll-create-a-new-tab-The-new-Presentation-Tab-can-be-set-up-however-you-want-but-the-setup-MUST-include-the-following\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

The “Use Permissions” checkbox must be checked<br>3. On the Permissions tab, select the Customer Center role(s) that you will assign to your Customer Center users, and give them at least “View” level access.<br>2.

Navigate to Setup &gt; Customization &gt; Center Tabs &gt; New to setup a new Custom Center Tab.</h3><p>1. You can enter any text you want for the Label (this is the label that will appear for the custom tab in Customer Center), but MUST select Center &#x3D; “Customer Center”.<br>2. Under Content &gt; Categories &gt; Label, you can enter any name you want (this is the label that will appear for the category in your custom tab).<br>3. Under Content &gt; Portlets &gt; Type, you MUST select Type &#x3D; “Links” and Show &#x3D; “Yes”.<br>4. Under Audience, make sure that the “Select All” checkbox is checked for the Roles list.<br>5. Save your new Custom Center tab.<br>2. Navigate to Setup &gt; Customization &gt; Center Tabs, and click on the NAME of the new Custom Center Tab that you just created (do NOT click on the “Edit” link; you want to view the Custom Center Tab that you just created).<br>1. Under Content &gt; Categories, click on the “Edit” link for the Category that you created.<br>2. On the Custom Center Category page, select the Link for the saved search that you created in the Common Steps section above (i.e., the saved search that you want to display on Customer Center).<br>1. IMPORTANT: When you look in the Link list for your saved search, you will find 2 entries for your saved search with similar names. One entry in the list will have “Results” in the name, the other will not have “Results” in the name. (For example, if your saved search is called “Subscription Data”, then you will see one entry in the Link list will be “Subscription Data”, and the second entry will be “Subscription Data Results”.) You MUST select the entry with “Results” in the name. The difference between these two entries is this: the link that does not have “Results” in the name (for example, “Subscription Data”) takes you to the page where you edit the search itself; the link with “Results” in the name (for example, “Subscription Data Results”) takes you to the page that shows the actual search results. Another way to look at this is like this: when you go to look at all of your Saved Searches in your normal NetSuite account, you always see two links next to each search. One link is called “Edit”, which takes you to the page where you define what the search is. The second link is called “Results”, which actually runs the search and takes you to a page that shows the results. The “Subscription Data” link is equivalent to the “Edit” link. The “Subscription Data Results” link is equivalent to the “Results” link.<br>3. Save your changes to the Custom Center Category.<br>3. Test this in Customer Center by logging in as one of your customers and verify the following:<br>1. You should see the new custom tab, category, and link you just created.<br>1. NOTE: If you don’t see the new tab, category, and&#x2F;or link, then you should hit CTRL-F5 to reload and re-cache each page in Customer Center so that you are sure that you are looking at the latest versions of the Customer Center pages.<br>2. When you click on the link, the search results should only display custom records associated with the customer that you are logged in as.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Method-2-Using-a-Published-Saved-Search\"><a href=\"#Method-2-Using-a-Published-Saved-Search\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Method 2: Using a Published Saved Search\"></a>Method 2: Using a Published Saved Search</h3><h3 id=\"1-Navigate-to-Lists-Web-Site-Tab-New-New-Presentation-Tab-to-create-a-new-Web-Site-Tab-where-you-can-access-your-published-saved-search-You-could-use-an-existing-tab-but-for-instruction-purposes-we’ll-create-a-new-tab-The-new-Presentation-Tab-can-be-set-up-however-you-want-but-the-setup-MUST-include-the-following\"><a href=\"#1-Navigate-to-Lists-Web-Site-Tab-New-New-Presentation-Tab-to-create-a-new-Web-Site-Tab-where-you-can-access-your-published-saved-search-You-could-use-an-existing-tab-but-for-instruction-purposes-we’ll-create-a-new-tab-The-new-Presentation-Tab-can-be-set-up-however-you-want-but-the-setup-MUST-include-the-following\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.
