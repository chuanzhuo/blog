It is a daunting task that requires proper planning, well-thought-out strategies, and a thorough understanding of the current system. This is crucial to ensure a smooth, rapid, and secure data migration process. Poor data mapping can result in the loss of critical data and key functionalities. Furthermore, it can lead to unexpected impacts on post-migration data and rules. This becomes especially tricky when migrating to an instance used by multiple users (rather than a new instance).

Reach out to your sales representative, and they will be happy to assist you!</p>\n<p><em><strong>What are SugarCRM custom field types?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Over the years, we have customized numerous SugarCRM fields for clients. Some of the many possibilities in SugarCRM field customization include phone field customization, custom email fields, autofill through postal codes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Can relationships be added to “custom SugarCRM fields” to automatically update one field’s value by changing another field’s value?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Yes, indeed. It is possible to automatically update one field’s value by changing another field’s value through SugarCRM customization.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How to manually create custom fields in SugarCRM?</strong></em></p>\n<p>There are several convenient ways to create custom fields in SugarCRM. You can use Sugar Studio to create basic custom SugarCRM fields without writing any code, or you can contact certified SugarCRM partner organizations (such as TMC) for advanced customization based on your unique requirements.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What is Sugar Studio?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Sugar Studio is a tool in SugarCRM that allows users to add basic customizations to fields and can also change the appearance of modules.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How to access Sugar Studio in SugarCRM?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Sugar Studio is located on the administration homepage. Only users with administrator privileges can access it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What is the purpose of having custom SugarCRM fields?</strong></em></p>\n<p>The default version of Sugar has only a few modules with default fields, including Marketing, Sales, and Support modules. However, in its default form, Sugar may not be useful for most businesses as each business has its unique processes and entities. Hence, it is common practice to add custom fields and modules and remove current fields and modules that are not necessarily relevant to the business’s CRM implementation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Can validation be set for SugarCRM custom fields to automatically update one field’s value by changing another field’s value?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Yes, you can update one field’s value by changing another field’s value. This can be achieved through SugarCRM customization.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How to delete any unnecessary custom fields in SugarCRM?</strong></em></p>\n<p>If you do not have any coding knowledge, you can use Sugar Studio to delete any unnecessary custom fields.<br>Furthermore, you can also contact SugarCRM experts like TMC, who can complete the task for you through code.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Self-Deployment\"><a href=\"#Self-Deployment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Self-Deployment\"></a>Self-Deployment</h1><p>docker-compose.yml</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">version:</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;3.5&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">services:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"attr\">suitecrm:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">image:</span> <span class=\"string\">docker.io/bitnami/suitecrm:8</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">ports:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;8100:8080&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;8101:8443&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">environment:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">SUITECRM_DATABASE_HOST=yourls_mysql</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">SUITECRM_DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER=3306</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">SUITECRM_DATABASE_USER=root</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">SUITECRM_DATABASE_NAME=yourls</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">SUITECRM_DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"comment\"># ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD is recommended only for development.</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"comment\">#- ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">volumes:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">&#x27;./suitecrm_data:/bitnami/suitecrm&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">#depends_on:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">#  - yourls_mysql</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">networks:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">      <span class=\"bullet\">-</span> <span class=\"string\">template_default</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">networks:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"attr\">template_default:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">external:</span> <span class=\"literal\">true</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"attr\">name:</span> <span class=\"string\">template_default</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>Uses the shared network template_default and a MariaDB database.
