It is used to report miscellaneous income, such as income earned as a non-employee, as well as fees, commissions, rents, or royalties paid during the last tax year. Payments for prizes, awards, legal services, and other non-employee activities may be reported on this form as well.  </p>\n<p>If a business pays you 600 US Dollars (USD) or more as a non-employee, it is legally required to report it to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), using a 1099-MISC form. For royalty income, a 1099-MISC must be generated for $10 USD or more in royalties. As the payee, you’ll receive your own copy of the form. Once you receive it, you should check it carefully for errors and keep it in a safe place. You’ll need to use it to report this income on your tax return.  </p>\n<p>Often, individuals think of non-employee income as extra money. This is particularly true if it amounts to less than $1000 USD. It is important to realize, however, that the IRS does not share this view and you are required to report all of your income, even when the amount you received was not enough to require the generation of a 1099-MISC. Furthermore, you may not choose to omit income from a particular source; you must include it all.  </p>\n<p>Any business that has paid you $600 USD or more as a non-employee, or at least $10 USD in royalties, must provide you with a 1099-MISC form by January 31st of the year following payment. If you are expecting a 1099-MISC and have not received it by January 31st, contact the organization that pays you and request a copy. You may also contact the IRS to request a copy. Keep in mind that you will need to verify your identity before the IRS will provide you with a copy of the form.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes, a 1099-MISC form will arrive with errors on it. If this happens to you, contact the paying organization for an amended copy. Don’t wait too long to request your new 1099-MISC, as you want to ensure you receive it early enough to file your tax return on time. Though the paying company is required to send the corrected form to the IRS, it is wise to send your own copy as well. This simply protects you from unnecessary hassle caused by discrepancies in the amounts reported.</p>\n<p><em>1099-MISC</em> 表格 样式 可以上google搜索一下：</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://images.google.cn/images?q=1099-misc&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:zh-CN:official&client=firefox-a&hl=zh-CN&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi\">http://images.google.cn/images?q=1099-misc&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:zh-CN:official&client=firefox-a&hl=zh-CN&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi</a></p>\n","more":"<p>What is 1099-MISC?美国的会计制度中的一个规定。谁给你付钱，谁就应该给你发一份。在某个公司的一个报税年里兼职收入超过 $600 ，他就应该给你发，你收到后要作为一项收入填到你的报税表上。A 1099-MISC is a type of tax form.
